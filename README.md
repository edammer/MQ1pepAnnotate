# MQ1pepAnnotate
Find and Annotate MS/MS Spectra for One-peptide Identifications in Thermo .RAW files searched using MaxQuant

This script leverages the protViz and rawrr R packages to produce annotated MS/MS peptide spectral matches.  Suitable for generating required supplemental data and table for publications in proteomic journals that require quality control and visualization of a dataset's full compendium of such peptides identified, quantified, and contributing to protein isoform-level quantitative rollup.

Please contact <a href="mailto:edammer@emory.edu">Eric Dammer</a> if you have questions about using or further adapting this script for different post-translational modifications of specific known mass shift or for further development to automate this script, or use it with other proteomic search engine outputs than MaxQuant /txt/ folder contents and Thermo .RAW files, and I will be happy to work with you.
